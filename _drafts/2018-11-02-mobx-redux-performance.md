>At Bing, we use multiple performance metrics for diagnostics, but
our key time-related metric is Time-To-Success (TTS) [24], which
side-steps the measurement issues. For a search engine, our goal is
to allow users to complete a task faster. For clickable elements, a
user clicking faster on a result from which they do not come back
for at least 30 seconds is considered a successful click. TTS as a
metric captures perceived performance well: if it improves, then
important areas of the pages are rendering faster so that users can
interpret the page and click faster. This relatively simple metric
does not suffer from heuristics needed for many performance
metrics. It is highly robust to changes, and very sensitive. Its main
deficiency is that it only works for clickable elements. For queries
where the SERP has the answer (e.g., for “time” query), users can
be satisfied and abandon the page without clicking.
